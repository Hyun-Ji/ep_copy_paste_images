# Paste images from clipboard into Etherpad

You need to use the support-images branch of Etherpad for this to work

https://github.com/ether/etherpad-lite/tree/support-images

# This plugin is WIP and isn't stable 

# TODO:
 - [x] Make it work on develop branch (see https://github.com/ether/etherpad-lite/pull/2497/files)
 - [ ] Support image resize
 - [ ] Support image drag and drop
 - [ ] Support wrap around image (This will never happen)
